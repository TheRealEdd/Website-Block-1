        <p>I've been taking pictures ever since I left secondary school. It started out as a hobby around my graphic
            design interests, and later developed into a more serious time investment. I have selected a few images here
            for your enjoyment. Feel free to click on any of them for more information!</p>

                        closer than you ever thought possible. This flower is around a centimetre in diameter.</p>

                        the far needles basking in the sunlight. This was one of those times.</p>

        <h2>This is a section about music.</h2>
        <p>Music has been a big part of my life growing up. I cannot remember when I first started singing and playing
            instruments, but I know that it was very early. These days I play when I feel like it, and own various
            instruments and bits of recording equipment that I use to sometimes save what I create. These are some of
            those fragments of my musical life.</p>

        <p>As you might have noticed while looking through my music and photography work, I can get sucked into my
            hobbies with great ease. Digital design is another one of those hobbies that started off as a little bit of
            fun, and later evolved into a great place to express my more visual art. This can include my photography too
            at times, but is mostly playing with shapes, colour, and light. Feel free to have a gander.</p>
